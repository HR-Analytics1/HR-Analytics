Project Plan: Competition and Collaboration
Phase One: The Individual Competition
In this phase, every team member will work independently to build a complete dashboard from start to finish. This ensures that everyone gains a comprehensive understanding of the entire project lifecycle.
The Task: Every person on the team, will create a single, complete dashboard on " HR Analytics." Each person can choose a specific area to focus on (e.g., salaries, attrition rate, job satisfaction, performance, etc.).
Team Members Involved: Ibrahim, Maryam, Ziad, Hassan, Hajar, and Abdelrahman.


Phase Two: Selection and Unification
Once everyone has completed their work, you will all meet to evaluate the dashboards and select the best ones.
Evaluation: The top three dashboards will be chosen based on criteria such as:
Data and calculation accuracy.
Design quality and ease of use.
The value of the insights derived.
Specialization: After the selection, the team will be re-grouped to refine the chosen dashboards based on individual strengths:
Ibrahim & Zeiad: Will review the DAX formulas in the three chosen dashboards to ensure they are accurate and consistent.
Abdelrahman: Will review the data cleaning processes for all three to ensure the underlying data is unified and clean.
Hassan & Mariam: Will be responsible for unifying the visual design (color schemes, fonts, etc.) across all dashboards and building the main page that links them together.
Hajar: Will review the final insights to ensure they meet business needs.
Phase Three: Final Product Delivery
The entire team will work on improving the three selected dashboards, under your leadership, to produce a final, integrated, and professional product
